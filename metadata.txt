about=Professional-grade terrain analysis toolkit for QGIS featuring:
    
    • Hydrological Analysis: D8 flow direction, flow accumulation, watershed delineation, depression filling, flow indices (TWI, SPI), flow distance/length, basin analysis
    
    • Geomorphometric Analysis: Slope, aspect, curvature, hillshade, roughness, TPI, openness, visibility analysis, hypsometric analysis
    
    • Stream Network: Stream extraction, Strahler/Shreve ordering, stream links, vectorization, gap joining, valley extraction
    
    • Structured Workflow: Organized tools following standard hydrology analysis workflow
    
    Key Features:
    - Numba JIT acceleration for 10-100x faster processing
    - Standard D8 flow direction encoding (industry-compatible)
    - Automatic symbology for flow direction and stream order
    - NoData handling with -9999 standard
    
    How to Use:
    1. Open Processing Toolbox (Ctrl+Alt+T)
    2. Expand "MAS Spatial Analysis Tool"
    3. Select algorithm category (Hydrological, Geomorphometric, Stream Network)
    4. Double-click tool to run
    5. Typical workflow: Fill DEM → Flow Direction → Flow Accumulation → Extract Streams
